# IMPORTANT!

When I integrated **Redux Global State Management** tool with the project, I got rid of states managed with useState() hook, I'm talking about fetching & listing users, because I managed the states using Redux, but you can find the way I did fetching & listing with useState() hooks aswell by watching my commit history.

All the best,
